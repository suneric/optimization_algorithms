# Optimization Algorithms for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)


## Traveling Salesman Problem
The [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/) is one of the most intensive studied problems in computational mathematics.
**Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once, and returns to the starting city?**
